I am highly interested in technology, and it\\'s something that truly fascinates me. I\\\\u2019ve never done software development, but I find programming interesting, and I am also into creative things like art. I appreciate the aesthetic beauty of things like waking up for a sunrise. This is why I think web development would suit me well. Eventually once I have gained a lot more knowledge and experience I want to create my own business. I am not too sure what kind of business it will be; the business I create is something I will find out along my professional journey.  Creating a successful business is my dream goal because I grew up with limited opportunities due to financial reasons. I want to be in a position where I can help out other people, and have any impact to make the world a better and more positive place.\",\"What industries interest you?\":\"The technology industry is something that really fascinates me. The power it brings to society is hard to wrap my head around. As a society we have become so much more advanced in just these past 50 years. Someone born in the early 1920s would be in a huge culture shock if they were somehow alive currently. It\\\\u2019s surreal the things we have accomplished with technology. We have things like virtual reality which will only get more advanced. These devices can trick your brain into thinking you\\\\u2019re experiencing a real scenario all through a headset. Another industry I am interested in is the music industry. Music has played such an integral role in my life. It helps me get through the tough times, and I love just listening to it and relaxing. The way artists manipulate sounds is bewildering, especially with the way those sounds affect our brains. \",\"Are you currently a parent or caretaker to someone?\":\"No\",\"What are you looking to gain from mentorship?\":\"I\\\\u2019m looking for a person to guide me to as much growth as possible. Ideally, this person will guide me to become my absolute best self. I\\\\u2019m looking to learn about my mentor\\\\u2019s mistakes or other mistakes learned from people in their network. Hopefully, my mentor will guide me on how to understand myself better and to overcome any challenges, especially mental ones. I would like a mentor who has started their own business because that is my number one career goal. \",\"Please list the neighborhoods, areas of the city, and suburbs that are convenient locations for you to meet with your mentor.\":\"Campbell, San Jose, Cupertino, Los Gatos \",\"Are there any communities\\\\/groups that you are a part of or are passionate about that you want your mentor to know? (Ex: LGBQT, Religious\\\\/Faith, etc.)\":\"Outdoor Groups, Music Community, Motorcycles\\\\/Cars \",\"What skills, interests, hobbies, or talents would you like to share with your mentor?\":\"My biggest passions\\\\/hobbies are motorcycles\\\\/cars and video games. Riding these vehicles to me are a heaven on earth because while driving all you do is focus on the road. All your problems\\\\/concerns are left behind. I am also a thrill seeker, so I love the adrenaline rush I get from riding motorcycles. Motorcycles and cars have such a high skill gap also. There is always room to improve, and seeing results is extremely satisfying. I love going to the race track to put my skills to the test and driving fast is not an easy task. I love the challenge it brings, and listening to music while driving is one of the best ways for me to accomplish self-care. I\\\\u2019ve played video games all my life, and it\\\\u2019s a way to keep in touch with my best friend who moved to Ohio. The creative aspect of video games is something I\\\\u2019m really interested in also. The artwork for the characters and level design can really stand out and impress me. Another thing I am interested in is parkour or freerunning. Freerunning is a variation of parkour but rather than focusing on speed it focuses on doing flashy tricks essentially. Parkour is all about getting from point a to point b as efficiently as possible. For example, a person may climb a wall to get onto a building and leap to the next building then jump down. I love being active and exercising. Another big hobby of mine is reading. Reading can bring someone so much knowledge and is a good way to spend your time. When reading you get lost in the world of the book, and it\\\\u2019s a productive way to pass the time as well. \",\"Do you foresee any challenges that would make it difficult to meet with your mentor?\":\"I do not foresee any challenges. The biggest thing would just be my internship which will be from 9am - 5pm. \",\"What are the top 1-3 priorities you would like us to consider when matching you to a mentor?\":\"A big priority of mine for the mentor would be for them to be a business owner in order to share their experience of running a business. Most importantly, this mentor should want to empower their mentee as much as possible. A mentor who would guide me to understand myself and become my absolute best self is the most important thing to me. \",\"What would you want your mentor to know about you before you meet?\":\"I am an introverted extrovert, and when I first meet people I may be a little awkward\\\\/quiet at first. If I behave like this at first, I don\\'t want my mentor to think that I am disinterested or anything of that nature. Another thing I would like them to know about me is that I love reading, and am aspiring to start my own business one day. My biggest and most important value in life is to create strong, meaningful relationships with as many people possible. I have two brothers in the military, and I have thought about joining the military as well but am still undecided.\",\"Please share the link to your LinkedIn profile.\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.linkedin.com\\\\/in\\\\/gabe-ko-317685182\\\\/\"},\"59\":{\"Timestamp\":1563562500124,\"Full Name\":\"Ofelia medina \",\"What is your age?\":20,\"Your Year Up email address?\":\"Omedina@sfo.yearup.org\",\"What LC are you a member of?\":\"LC Empower\",\"Learning Track\":\"IT\",\"Are you interested in joining the Mentor Program?\":\"Yes, sign me up!\",\"If you answered NO, I am not interested in joining the Mentor Program, please briefly explain why? \":null,\"Best phone number to reach you at:\":14083860205,\"In what city do you live?\":\"San Jose\",\"Do you have access to a car?\":\"Yes\",\"Career field interest\":\"Business \",\"What industries interest you?\":\"Cosmetology., tech, business \",\"Are you currently a parent or caretaker to someone?\":\"No\",\"What are you looking to gain from mentorship?\":\"I plan on expanding my knowledge and hoping to build a bond in where I can count on a person with any issues \",\"Please list the neighborhoods, areas of the city, and suburbs that are convenient locations for you to meet with your mentor.\":\"Open to meeting anywhere within the Bay Area preferably San Jos\\\\u00e9 or Oakland where I stand most \",\"Are there any communities\\\\/groups that you are a part of or are passionate about that you want your mentor to know?
